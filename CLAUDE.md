# CLAUDE.md — Jewel Factory (clean rebuild)

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo.

## What this is

A **clean single-app rebuild** of the old `../LuxeMatch` B2B jewellery platform.
Same features, same UI, zero dead code. Built phase-by-phase from
`../LuxeMatch/JEWEL_FACTORY_SYSTEM_DESIGN.txt` (the blueprint — read it for full context).

**Workspace layout:** three repos sit as SIBLINGS in one parent folder — `LuxeMatch/`
(git `B2B_Luxmatch`, reference only), `AI-Features/` (git `Jewel-Factory_AI`), and
`Jewel Factory/` (this app). The `../LuxeMatch` and `../AI-Features` relative paths
in the docs depend on this layout. Clone order + commands: `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` §6.

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + Hono BFF + Prisma (Supabase Postgres) +
Tailwind v4 (CSS-first, no config file) + shadcn/ui (new-york) + lucide + motion.
**Single app** — NO monorepo, NO `packages/*`. Everything under `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`.

## Actors — MULTI-STORE hierarchy (read docs/flow.md for the full flow)

> **Terminology (UI name vs code/table):** the DB kept its original table names when
> the hierarchy was added, so watch the mapping:
> - `stores` table + `jf_store` login = **Retailer** (= Head Office; was "Store Owner")
> - `store_managers` table = **LEGACY/INERT** — the old "HO Manager" role is REMOVED; table kept only for historical approver FK rows, no login/creation
> - `branches` table = **Store** (a retailer's individual shop) — NEW
> - `branch_managers` table + `jf_branch_manager` login = **Store Manager** — NEW

**3 staff roles + Customer:**
1. **Manufacturer** — global catalog (Gold only, NO price, auto `JF-XXXX`), approves **Retailer** registrations, receives B2B/kiosk/custom orders. NEVER sees customer data; ships to the **Retailer's fixed HO address**. Portal `/manufacturer/*`.
2. **Retailer** (`stores`) = **Head Office** — self-registers → manufacturer approves. Has ONE fixed HO address. Creates its **Stores (branches)** and each branch's Store Managers. **Also does ALL approvals** (kiosk/B2B/custom) for every branch, can **edit the requirement note**, and chats with Store Managers per order — this absorbs everything the old "HO Manager" did. Portal `/store/*` (login `/store/login`). Branch mgmt at `/store/branches`.
3. **Store Manager** (`branch_managers`) — runs ONE branch. Login `/store-manager/login` → that branch's **Kiosk** (customer, no PII) + **Restock** (PIN-walled). Sends orders to the Retailer (Head Office) for approval. Portal `/store-manager/*`.
4. **Customer** — walk-in, NO login, **NO data stored**. The Store Manager helps them on the kiosk. Requirement captured as an editable note only. (Legacy public kiosk `/<storeSlug>/*` still exists but the primary path is the Store Manager's `/store-manager/kiosk`.)

## Core rules (never break)

- **No price, no metal** anywhere (manufacturer form, catalog, kiosk, orders).
- **Auto design number** `JF-0001` via Postgres sequence (`lib/design-number.ts`).
- **Customer PII is NOT stored and never reaches the manufacturer.** Kiosk/custom orders carry only products + qty + an editable `requirementNote`. Customer name/phone are nullable (store manager keeps them outside the system). Manufacturer sees: retailer name, branch name, requirement note, retailer HO ship-to address.
- **The requirement note** (`requirementNote` on kiosk/B2B orders) is written by the Store Manager, **editable by Store Manager AND Retailer (Head Office)** (PATCH `/store/{kiosk,b2b}-orders/:id/note`), and forwarded to the manufacturer.
- **Restock is PIN-walled** per branch (`branches.restock_pin_hash`, cookie `jf_restock`). Set/reset by Store Manager or Retailer (Head Office).
- **Store Manager "My Orders"** (`/store-manager/my-orders`) — their branch's kiosk/custom/restock orders with status (Pending→Approved→**Completed**). Store Manager sets **Completed** (`completedAt`) when the piece reaches the customer/store — a flag, separate from the approval status.
- **Per-order chat** (`order_messages`, polymorphic by `OrderKind`+orderId) — Retailer (Head Office) ↔ Store Manager, scoped by `storeId`. APIs: `/api/store/messages/:kind/:id` (Head Office) and `/api/branch-manager/messages/:kind/:id` (Store Manager). Shared UI `components/orders/OrderChat.tsx`. **NOTE:** the `MessageSender.HO` enum value and `OrderChat` `viewer='HO'` / `sender:'HO'` are DATA — do NOT rename them; only display text reads "Head Office".
- **Store Manager storefront = LuxeMatch look** (rich hero + sections), header/nav/branding = Jewel Factory. Gold-only — no blue/diamond stock imagery. Don't simplify it back to a plain dashboard.
- **Owner-approve writes `null`** to `*ApprovedById`/`reviewedById` (the Retailer/owner is not a `StoreManager` row — see `approverIdOrNull` in `lib/api/guards.ts`). Since the HO Manager role is gone, `approverIdOrNull` now **always returns null** (all approvals are the owner).
- **Kiosk order items** carry `manufacturerProductId` + snapshots; `product_id` FK is for STORE products only.
- **Branding on kiosk** — store's own logo + name; footer "Powered by AT Jewellers".

## Auth (3 login cookies + 2 PIN cookies)

| Cookie | Role (UI) | Secret | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jf_manufacturer` | Manufacturer | `MANUFACTURER_SECRET` | `manufacturerId` |
| `jf_store` | Retailer (Head Office) | `STORE_SECRET` | `storeId` (= retailerId) |
| `jf_manager` | **REMOVED** (was HO Manager) — login gone; `MANAGER_SECRET` still exists in env but no cookie is issued | `MANAGER_SECRET` | *(deprecated)* |
| `jf_branch_manager` | Store Manager | `BRANCH_MANAGER_SECRET` (falls back to `MANAGER_SECRET`) | `bmId.branchId.retailerId` |
| `jf_kiosk` | legacy kiosk device unlock | `STORE_SECRET:kiosk` | `storeId` |
| `jf_restock` | branch restock unlock (PIN) | `STORE_SECRET:restock` | `branchId` |

> The `store_managers` DB table remains for historical approver FK references only — no login/creation.

All HMAC-SHA256 (Web Crypto, Edge-safe, `lib/auth.ts`). Passwords bcrypt (`lib/password.ts`, Node-only).
Guards in `lib/api/guards.ts`: `manufacturerGuard`, `storeGuard` (retailer/owner-only), `managerGuard` (now **owner-only** — accepts `jf_store` only; the HO-manager fallback is removed, so `isOwner` is always true), `branchManagerGuard` (store manager; sets `branchId` + `branchManagerId` + `storeId`=retailerId for tenancy). Branch-manager API is `/api/branch-manager/*` (`lib/api/routes/branch-manager.ts`), per-route guarded.

## Tenancy

- Store-scoped queries filter by `storeId` (from cookie via guard, never body).
- Manufacturer queries filter by `manufacturerId`.
- Kiosk: `storeSlug` from URL resolves the store server-side (`app/[storeSlug]/layout.tsx` + kiosk API bodies carry `storeSlug`).
- Prisma is the data layer — no service-role RLS-bypass footgun; add checks in code.

## Order flows

- **Kiosk:** customer → `placeKioskOrder` (pendingStoreApproval) → manager approves (`forwardedToManufacturer=true`) → manufacturer (PII stripped, ships to store address).
- **B2B:** store cart → `placeB2bOrder` (pendingManagerApproval) → manager approves → manufacturer → on DELIVERED, `fulfillB2bOrder` materializes into store `Product` table (transactional).
- **Custom design:** kiosk form → `CustomDesignRequest` (PII) → manager approves → `forwardCustomRequest` creates sanitized `CustomDesignOrder` (transactional, atomic) → manufacturer.

## Store registration → approval → email

- Store self-registers at `/store/register` (status `PENDING`, `isActive=false`, no `manufacturerId`). (A `store_managers` row may still be written silently in the same transaction, but it is inert — there is no HO Manager login; the Retailer is the Head Office.)
- Manufacturer approves at `/manufacturer/store-registrations` → `approveRegistration` sets `APPROVED` + `isActive=true` + links `manufacturerId`, and returns owner email + slug + manager emails.
- On approve, the store OWNER gets a **store-approved email** (`storeApprovedEmail` in `lib/email.ts`, sent fire-and-forget from `manufacturer-stores.ts`): confirmation + owner/manager login emails + portal URLs + kiosk URL (`/<slug>`) + forgot-password links. **No passwords** in the email (bcrypt-hashed; owner set them at registration). Email only sends if SMTP is configured, else logs to console — never blocks approval.
- Store + managers are NOT hardcoded — only `pnpm db:seed` with `SEED_DEMO_STORE=true` creates the demo store for testing.

## External services (same as old system)

- **Cloudinary** — signed direct upload (`lib/cloudinary.ts`). Buckets: catalog, tryon (png only), logo.
- **Qdrant** — one collection `QDRANT_MANUFACTURER_COLLECTION` (customers search manufacturer catalog).
- **OpenCLIP embedder** — 512-d visual search (`lib/search.ts`, `EMBEDDER_URL`, `POST /embed/image`, Bearer auth). Indexing fire-and-forget on image add.
- **AI-Features service** (separate Python repo: `github.com/teamai-botivate/Jewel-Factory_AI`, deploy on HF Docker Space) — **ONE service for all AI**: `/catalog`, `/transparent`, `/describe` (OpenAI, gated by `x-api-key`=`AI_FEATURES_API_KEY`) **and** `/embed/*` (OpenCLIP, merged in — same contract as the old embedder). Env: `AI_FEATURES_URL` + `AI_FEATURES_API_KEY`. **The embedder is now part of this service** — point `EMBEDDER_URL` at the same Space (`/embed/image` unchanged). If `AI_FEATURES_URL` is unset, the manufacturer "Generate with AI" button is hidden and manual add works as before.
  - **Manufacturer Add Design → "Generate with AI"**: raw photo (temp, not saved) → `/api/manufacturer/ai/{describe,catalog,transparent}` (server proxy `lib/api/routes/manufacturer-ai.ts`, forwards with `x-api-key`) → auto-fills name/description + catalog image + transparent try-on PNG. All editable; regenerate + custom `extraInstructions` supported. Uses the existing `handleImageUpload`/`handleTryonUpload` flow (base64 → File).
- **SMTP** — password reset + store-approval email (`lib/email.ts`; logs to console if unset, never blocks the flow). On Render: use **port 465** (587 is blocked → `ETIMEDOUT`) and the transporter forces **`family: 4`** (Render can't reach Gmail over IPv6 → `ENETUNREACH`). `lib/email.ts` logs `[email] sent to …` / `[email] send FAILED: …` so Render Logs show the real reason.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install                    # deps + prisma generate
pnpm dev | build | start | typecheck | lint
pnpm db:migrate | db:deploy | db:seed | db:studio | db:generate
SEED_DEMO_STORE=true pnpm db:seed   # + demo store at /demo
pnpm migrate:categories             # map legacy flat categories -> 14-cat taxonomy (existing DB only)
pnpm migrate:branches               # Option-A: default "Main Store" branch per retailer + link old orders (existing DB only)
```

## Setup for a fresh DB

1. `cp .env.example .env` — fill DATABASE_URL + DIRECT_URL (Supabase), secrets (min 32 chars: MANUFACTURER/STORE/MANAGER/**BRANCH_MANAGER**), Cloudinary, Qdrant, EMBEDDER_URL (+ optional AI_FEATURES_URL/AI_FEATURES_API_KEY for AI generate), SMTP. No `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` — app uses Postgres directly, not Supabase Auth.
2. `pnpm db:deploy` (runs all 5 migrations → full schema, no manual SQL) then `pnpm db:seed` (1 manufacturer + 14 categories).
3. `pnpm dev`.
**New agent / new machine? Read [`docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`](docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md) first** — full backstory, every big decision + why, what's pending, and how the owner likes to work. It gives you the same context the previous agent had.

**All docs live in `docs/` (except this file + `README.md`, which stay at the repo root).**
Handover / client onboarding: `docs/HANDOVER.md` (zero-to-live). Schema: `docs/DATABASE.md`.
Full system flow: `docs/flow.md`. Detailed dev setup: `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`. Render deploy:
`docs/DEPLOY_RENDER.md`. AWS migration plan: `docs/AWS_MIGRATION.md`. Pending work / checklist:
`docs/PENDING.md`. End-user (non-technical) guide with roles + demo login credentials +
step-by-step workflows: `docs/USER_MANUAL.md`.

## Migrations (5, all Prisma-managed, idempotent)
`0001 jewel_factory` · `kiosk_pin` · `b2b_item_image` · `branch_hierarchy` (branches + branch_managers + branch_id/requirement_note on orders + nullable PII) · `order_messages` (order_messages table + OrderKind/MessageSender enums + completed_at on kiosk/b2b/custom). `pnpm db:deploy` applies all. `migrate:categories`/`migrate:branches` = one-off upgrades for an EXISTING DB only.

## Status

**Latest session — public landing + docs reorg:**
- **Branded landing** at `/` (was "Rebuild in progress"): navbar (logo · Catalog · About · Login · Register) + hero + **featured real-catalog showcase** (public `GET /api/kiosk/catalog`, no price) + "why" cards + footer. **Login popup** = 2 columns (Retailer | Store Manager) via `components/landing/LoginModal.tsx` reusing `StaffLoginForm` in a new `bare` mode. **Register prompt** auto-opens ~5s once per session (`components/landing/RegisterPromptModal.tsx`, sessionStorage). New **`/about`** page. **`/manufacturer`** is a hidden admin entry — visiting it shows the manufacturer login popup (`app/manufacturer/page.tsx`). **`/portal` deleted → redirects to `/`**; signOut + login footers repointed to `/`.
- **Similar-design (visual) search** surfaced on landing + About (real Store Manager `/search` feature, AI-Features `/embed`).
- **Responsive pass** — app was already mostly mobile-aware; fixed hero headings (smaller base + break-words), a retailer-row truncation, and card/heading padding.
- **Docs moved to `docs/`** (except this file + `README.md`); `SYSTEM_FLOW.txt` → `docs/flow.md`; stale `USER_FLOWS_AND_GUIDE.txt` deleted.

**HO Manager role REMOVED (prior session):** The Retailer is now the Head Office and does everything the old HO Manager did (all kiosk/custom/restock approvals + per-order chat + all order lists/filters) plus its own tasks. `/store/manager/*` + `/api/manager/*` + the Managers(HO) page (`/store/managers`) are deleted. The `store_managers` table is kept but inert (historical approver FKs only). `isOwner` is always true in store-ops now; `approverIdOrNull` always returns null. The `MessageSender.HO` enum + `OrderChat` `viewer='HO'`/`sender:'HO'` values are DATA — unchanged; only display text says "Head Office".

**Multi-store hierarchy + Store Manager storefront + per-order chat: all on branch `retailer-multistore`.**
Retailer (Head Office) → Stores(branches) → Store Managers → Customer. Store Manager has a
full LuxeMatch-style storefront (hero/catalog/try-on/search/custom/restock) + My Orders
(status, Mark Completed, Head Office chat). Head Office ↔ Store Manager per-order chat both sides.
**Live DB (Supabase) has all 5 migrations applied** (branch_hierarchy + order_messages done;
`migrate:branches` run once). `master` stays at the pre-hierarchy state — **merge `retailer-multistore` → `master` when handing over.**

**Latest session (all on `retailer-multistore`):**
- **AI Add Design** — manufacturer "Generate with AI" (raw photo → name/description + catalog image + transparent try-on PNG via AI-Features); field order = specs → AI panel → name → rest; new products default **Active**; generated catalog/try-on images click-to-zoom (lightbox). Race-lock on `ensureProductId` (no double product). AI proxy lowercases the HF host (307 body-drop → 502 fix) and surfaces the real upstream error. **AI-Features (`../AI-Features`, HF Space `Botivate2026/ai-workspace`) currently returns OpenAI `429 insufficient_quota` → add OpenAI credit to make generation work.**
- **Transparent try-on prompt** (AI-Features `lib/prompts.py`) — necklace + bangle now render FRONT drape only (open U/V, no back chain/clasp) so 2D overlay sits correctly; regenerate old assets after HF redeploy.
- **Store Manager kiosk + search** — product cards open a detail modal (gallery, specs, description, **Try On** when AR, **Similar designs**); modal image click-to-zoom; close X at card top-right; Try-On page reads `?product=` (auto-select) + `?back=` (Back button to originating page).
- **Login fix** — `StaffLoginForm` resets loading on a server error (wrong creds no longer freeze the button). Affects all 4 logins.
- **HO ↔ Store Manager chat** added on the HO custom-designs page (was only on pending-approvals). Store Manager no longer sees the manufacturer's granular status ("Approved by HO" only).
- **Nav** — removed "Kiosk PIN" from the Retailer sidebar (managed per-Store on Branches); "Store Profile" → "**Retailer Profile**". (The old HO Manager sidebar is gone — the Retailer/Head Office has the full menu.)
- **Order filters (all lists)** — reusable `components/orders/OrderFilters.tsx` + `lib/order-filters.ts`: order-ID search + status dropdown + **From/To date range** (on `createdAt`) everywhere; **Store (branch) filter** on HO lists (kiosk/custom/b2b) with a branch badge per row; **Retailer filter** on Manufacturer lists (kiosk/custom/orders); Store Manager My Orders searches by order-ID + derived status bucket + date range. HO custom list gained `branch{name}` via `listCustomRequests`.
- **Wordmark** — landing + About navbars use a **"JEWEL FACTORY" text wordmark** (`FACTORY` in gold `#c9a84c`), NOT `public/logo-wordmark.png` — that PNG still shows "LUXEMATCH", so don't use it. Favicon is `public/logo-icon.png`.

## Latest updates (branch: `feature/order-image-zoom`)

**Abhay's UI Refinements (8 commits on `renderdep`):**
- **Auth UI consolidation** — `PortalLoginScreen.tsx` + `PortalShell.tsx` reusable components consolidate login + registration; all 4 sign-in screens (Retailer, Manufacturer, Store Manager, Register) share one look.
- **Store Manager layout polish** — Mobile hamburger nav + page-title tracking (tabs show "Catalog | Search | ...") + store-logo fallback favicon.
- **Landing page assets** — Wordmark component + new branding AVIF logos (JF monogram, Jewel Factory logo, store medallion fallback, register hero image).
- **Responsive fixes** — Mobile-friendly hero headings + padding tweaks.
- **Code quality** — Variable renaming (p → product, res → response), alphabetized imports, useEffect cleanup (cancelled flag).
- **Render deploy config** — `render.yaml` + `.env.example` clarified for Blueprint env prompts (BRANCH_MANAGER_SECRET, AI_FEATURES_URL, AI_FEATURES_API_KEY).
- **AR viewport enhancements** — `fill` prop for full-screen immersive try-on + `onCameraAspectRatioChange` callback for responsive camera.

**Order Image Zoom Feature (ALL 8 order pages + new component):**
- **New component:** `components/orders/ImageZoomModal.tsx` — Lightbox modal (click image → zoom, next/prev for galleries, close via × or Escape).
- **Product details shown:** Product Name + Design Number (from `productDesignSnapshot` on B2B; from FK lookup on kiosk). Custom orders show "Reference Image".
- **Integrated on all 8 pages:**
  - Store Manager: `/store-manager/my-orders` (kiosk/custom/restock tabs)
  - Retailer (HO): `/store/{pending-approvals, kiosk-orders, b2b-orders, custom-designs}` 
  - Manufacturer: `/manufacturer/{kiosk-orders, orders/[id], custom-designs}`
- **UX:** Thumbnail click → modal. Multiple images render gallery counter + next/prev arrows. Close × top-right, ESC key, click outside.

**Landing Page Animation Demo (Hero → Features Section):**
- **New section** added right after hero (`app/page.tsx` lines ~152–190): "Find similar designs with AI in seconds." — **AI-Powered branding throughout**
- **AI Similar Image Search workflow animation (4s loop, wide max-w-5xl, compact height py-8/12):**
  1. Upload box appears (0–0.6s): Search icon scales in, "Drag & drop or click to upload" text
  2. Search progress (0.4–0.7s): 3 pulsing dots + "Searching similar designs…" (loads while upload fades)
  3. Results appear (2.5s+): 4 catalog products in horizontal grid fade-in + scale, **"AI found similar designs"** label
  - Real workflow demo: upload → AI search → results discovered
  - Demonstrates the AI-powered visual-search feature so visitors understand the capability
- **Layout:** Single column, wider container (max-w-5xl, not max-w-2xl). Compact padding: card p-5, boxes p-4/5, results grid 4 cols. Slides in from bottom (y: 24) on scroll trigger via `whileInView`.
- **Purpose:** Showcase AI-powered Similar Search with realistic animation so visitors instantly see the intelligent discovery feature on the landing page.

**Similar Design Search for Retailers (Head Office):**
- **Feature:** Retailers now have the same AI-powered similar design search as Store Managers
- **Implementation:**
  - New API endpoint: `POST /api/store/search/image` (store-portal.ts) — protected by `storeGuard`
  - New UI page: `/store/similar-search` (upload image → find similar catalog pieces)
  - Same visual-search logic: embed image → search Qdrant vector DB → return similar manufacturer products
  - New menu item in Retailer sidebar under "Operations" section
- **Usage:** Retailer can upload a jewelry photo to discover visually similar pieces from the manufacturer catalog
- **Same as:** Store Manager search feature (`/store-manager/search`), but accessible from Retailer portal

## Gotchas

- Catch-all route MUST export every method incl. **PUT** (password resets use PUT). The old LuxeMatch app 405'd because PUT was missing.
- Manufacturer product delete removes children + detaches store products, else archives (FK-safe).
- ar-engine copied verbatim — `overlayMath.ts` is the shared source of truth; mirror landmarks once then smooth; Y-down camera. Don't fight it.
- Try-on `Calibration` uses snake_case fields (`pivot_x`, `x_offset`, …).
- No price component anywhere — audit before adding product UI.
- **Auth cookies = `SameSite=Lax` + `credentials:'same-origin'`** on every authed fetch; login uses `window.location.assign` (not router.push) so the cookie is committed before the dashboard's first API call. Strict + router.push caused a login→redirect loop.
- **Hono `.use('*', guard)` leaks across sub-apps mounted on the same base.** store-portal + store-catalog apply `storeGuard` PER-ROUTE (not `.use('*')`) so a manager's `/store/dashboard` isn't 401'd by an owner-only wildcard. Only store-ops keeps a wildcard (managerGuard). Don't add a second `.use('*')` on `/store`.
- **SMTP on Render:** port **465** (587 blocked → ETIMEDOUT) + `family: 4` in the transporter (IPv6 unreachable → ENETUNREACH). `family` isn't in nodemailer's TS type — cast `as nodemailer.TransportOptions`.
- **Order-item images:** kiosk items snapshot the image at order time; B2B items snapshot image + design number (migration `20260715120000_b2b_item_image`) — only orders placed AFTER that commit have B2B images. Store list APIs `include: { items: true }`; thumbnails are `h-20 w-20 object-contain` on white.
- **Migrations on Supabase pooler** hit an advisory-lock timeout via `migrate dev`. Workaround used: apply DDL with `prisma db execute --url <DIRECT_URL>`, hand-write the migration file, and insert the `_prisma_migrations` row manually. The `20260717000000_branch_hierarchy` migration is hand-authored + idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS / DROP NOT NULL) so a partial re-run is safe. Render runs `pnpm run start` (`next start`) — migrations are NOT auto-applied; use `pnpm render-start` or Docker to auto-migrate.
- **Terminology trap:** `stores` table = Retailer (= Head Office), `store_managers` = **legacy/inert** (old HO Manager role removed; kept for historical approver FKs), `branches` = Store, `branch_managers` = Store Manager. Don't assume "store" means a shop in code — it's the retailer. New shop-level things go on `branches`.
- **Don't rename the `MessageSender.HO` enum or `OrderChat` `viewer='HO'`/`sender:'HO'` values** — those are DATA (stored rows + wire values). The HO Manager role is gone, but "HO" here just means the Head Office side of the chat, which is now the Retailer. Only the display text should read "Head Office".
- **Branch tenancy:** `branchManagerGuard` sets `storeId = retailerId`, so existing retailer-scoped DB helpers work unchanged; `branchId` narrows to the shop. Kiosk/restock orders from a branch carry `branchId` + `branchNameSnapshot`.
- **Kiosk sanitize is a DENYLIST** (`manufacturer-orders.ts sanitizeKiosk`) — it drops `customerName/Phone/Email/deliveryAddress` and lets everything else (incl. `branchNameSnapshot`, `requirementNote`) pass through. Any NEW PII field must be added to the drop-list.
- **`CustomDesignOrder` has NO branch/requirement columns** (only the sanitized snapshot). To surface branch/note on the manufacturer's custom-design view you'd add columns there + copy them in `forwardCustomRequest`.
- **Full-bleed sections:** the store-manager `layout` `<main>` is full-width (no `max-w`). Sections use `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto px-6`. For an edge-to-edge band use `left-1/2 w-screen -translate-x-1/2` — **NOT** `left-1/2 right-1/2 -mx-[50vw]` (that combo collapsed the hero). Non-home store-manager pages add their own `px-4 py-6` since the layout no longer pads.
- **`order_messages` is polymorphic** (`orderKind` + `orderId`, no FK) so one table serves kiosk/b2b/custom chat. Always query it scoped by `storeId`. `OrderChat.tsx` is shared — pass `viewer` ('HO' | 'STORE_MANAGER') and the right `basePath`.
- **`completedAt` is a flag, not a status** — set by the Store Manager via `markKiosk/B2b/CustomCompleted(branchId, id)`. Doesn't touch the approval status enum (avoids clashing with the existing flow).
- **Store Manager storefront images must be gold** (gold-only business). Try-On banner pulls a real catalog piece, not a stock photo; hero background is a gold showroom. Don't reintroduce blue/diamond stock imagery.
- **Order filters are CLIENT-SIDE.** `OrderFilters` (search + status + group dropdown + From/To date) + `lib/order-filters.ts` (`matchOrder`, `inDateRange`, `uniqueBranchOptions`, `*_STATUS_OPTIONS`). Pages fetch all orders then filter in a `useMemo`. The "group" dropdown is generic: HO passes the **branch** name (`branchNameSnapshot`), Manufacturer passes the **retailer** name (`storeNameSnapshot`/`storeName`) into `matchOrder`'s `branchName`. Date range filters on `createdAt` (`inDateRange` compares the `YYYY-MM-DD` slice lexicographically — every list row must carry `createdAt`). If you paginate/switch to server-side, move this into the API query params instead. Store Manager filters on a DERIVED bucket (`bucketOf`/`customBucketOf`), not the raw enum (it never shows manufacturer status).
- **Login handler must reset loading on error.** `StaffLoginForm.submit` sets `setLoading(false)` before the error `return`; only the success path (which `window.location.assign`s away) leaves it true. Don't remove it or wrong creds freeze the button again.
- **AI generation runs on OpenAI** (via AI-Features). A `502` on `/api/manufacturer/ai/*` usually wraps an OpenAI `429 insufficient_quota` — check OpenAI billing, not the app. HF Space `AI_FEATURES_URL` must be **lowercase** (capital host 307-redirects and drops the POST body).
